For my homage I decided to channel MonsGeek's website

https://www.monsgeek.com/

They are a mechanical keyboard manufacturer.
Their site seemed to have a broad range of stuff we have covered and that would be fun to emmulate.

For the most part I have tried to coppy the site exactly,
with a few self-assessed improvements and fixes where I think they were needed.
The site was really badly designed on lower screen widths particularly.

The carousel's i've implented are the best I could do without javascript.
They work most of the time but freeze sometimes if you try and swipe through them too fast.


--- NOTE ---

I made the mistake of deciding to finish off my homage and then converting the css to SASS after it was finished.
When starting my conversion, I realised how powerful it was and how I could have implemented functions, mixins and extends way better than I had time to do.
Unfortunately I haven't utilised SASS to a degree I know I'm capable of but lesson learned.
